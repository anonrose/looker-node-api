/**
 * Looker API 3.1 Reference
 * ### Authorization  The Looker API uses Looker **API3** credentials for authorization and access control. Looker admins can create API3 credentials on Looker's **Admin/Users** page. Pass API3 credentials to the **_/login** endpoint to obtain a temporary access_token. Include that access_token in the Authorization header of Looker API requests. For details, see [Looker API Authorization](https://looker.com/docs/r/api/authorization)  ### Client SDKs  The Looker API is a RESTful system that should be usable by any programming language capable of making HTTPS requests. Client SDKs for a variety of programming languages can be generated from the Looker API's Swagger JSON metadata to streamline use of the Looker API in your applications. A client SDK for Ruby is available as an example. For more information, see [Looker API Client SDKs](https://looker.com/docs/r/api/client_sdks)  ### Try It Out!  The 'api-docs' page served by the Looker instance includes 'Try It Out!' buttons for each API method. After logging in with API3 credentials, you can use the \"Try It Out!\" buttons to call the API directly from the documentation page to interactively explore API features and responses.  Note! With great power comes great responsibility: The \"Try It Out!\" button makes API calls to your live Looker instance. Be especially careful with destructive API operations such as `delete_user` or similar. There is no \"undo\" for API operations.  ### Versioning  Future releases of Looker will expand this API release-by-release to securely expose more and more of the core power of Looker to API client applications. API endpoints marked as \"beta\" may receive breaking changes without warning (but we will try to avoid doing that). Stable (non-beta) API endpoints should not receive breaking changes in future releases. For more information, see [Looker API Versioning](https://looker.com/docs/r/api/versioning)  This **API 3.1** is in active development. This is where support for new Looker features will appear as non-breaking additions - new functions, new optional parameters on existing functions, or new optional properties in existing types. Additive changes should not impact your existing application code that calls the Looker API. Your existing application code will not be aware of any new Looker API functionality until you choose to upgrade your app to use a newer Looker API client SDK release.  The following are a few examples of noteworthy items that have changed between API 3.0 and API 3.1. For more comprehensive coverage of API changes, please see the release notes for your Looker release.   ### Examples of new things added in API 3.1:  * Dashboard construction APIs * Themes and custom color collections APIs * Create and run SQL_runner queries * Create and run merged results queries * Create and modify dashboard filters * Create and modify password requirements   ### Deprecated in API 3.0  The following functions and properties have been deprecated in API 3.0.  They continue to exist and work in API 3.0 for the next several Looker releases but they have not been carried forward to API 3.1:  * Dashboard Prefetch functions * User access_filter functions * User API 1.0 credentials functions * Space.is_root and Space.is_user_root properties. Use Space.is_shared_root and Space.is_users_root instead.   ### Semantic changes in API 3.1:  * `all_looks` no longer includes soft-deleted looks, matching `all_dashboards` behavior. You can find soft-deleted looks using `search_looks` with the `deleted` param set to True. * `all_spaces` no longer includes duplicate items * `search_users` no longer accepts Y,y,1,0,N,n for Boolean params, only \"true\" and \"false\". * For greater client and network compatibility, `render_task_results` now returns HTTP status ***202 Accepted*** instead of HTTP status ***102 Processing*** * `all_running_queries` and `kill_query` functions have moved into the `Query` function group.   If you have application code which relies on the old behavior of the APIs above, you may continue using the API 3.0 functions in this Looker release. We strongly suggest you update your code to use API 3.1 analogs as soon as possible.

    /**
     * Login
     * ### Present client credentials to obtain an authorization token  Looker API implements the OAuth2 [Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant](https://looker.com/docs/r/api/outh2_resource_owner_pc) pattern. The client credentials required for this login must be obtained by creating an API3 key on a user account in the Looker Admin console. The API3 key consists of a public &#x60;client_id&#x60; and a private &#x60;client_secret&#x60;.  The access token returned by &#x60;login&#x60; must be used in the HTTP Authorization header of subsequent API requests, like this: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; Authorization: token 4QDkCyCtZzYgj4C2p2cj3csJH7zqS5RzKs2kTnG4 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; Replace \&quot;4QDkCy...\&quot; with the &#x60;access_token&#x60; value returned by &#x60;login&#x60;. The word &#x60;token&#x60; is a string literal and must be included exactly as shown.  This function can accept &#x60;client_id&#x60; and &#x60;client_secret&#x60; parameters as URL query params or as www-form-urlencoded params in the body of the HTTP request. Since there is a small risk that URL parameters may be visible to intermediate nodes on the network route (proxies, routers, etc), passing credentials in the body of the request is considered more secure than URL params.  Example of passing credentials in the HTTP request body: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;&#x60; POST HTTP /login Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded  client_id&#x3D;CGc9B7v7J48dQSJvxxx&amp;client_secret&#x3D;nNVS9cSS3xNpSC9JdsBvvvvv &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;  ### Best Practice: Always pass credentials in body params. Pass credentials in URL query params **only** when you cannot pass body params due to application, tool, or other limitations.

     * ### Create an access token for a given user.  This can only be called by an authenticated admin user. It allows that admin to generate a new authentication token for the user with the given user id. That token can then be used for subsequent API calls - which are then performed *as* that target user.  The target user does *not* need to have a pre-existing API client_id/client_secret pair. And, no such credentials are created by this call.  This allows for building systems where api user authentication for an arbitrary number of users is done outside of Looker and funneled through a single &#39;service account&#39; with admin permissions. Note that a new access token is generated on each call. If target users are going to be making numerous API calls in a short period then it is wise to cache this authentication token rather than call this before each of those API calls.  See &#39;login&#39; for more detail on the access token and how to use it.
